    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
  })}. The ideas you generate must be relevant to right now. Generate a list of innovative business ideas based on current trends and news from credible sources. For each idea, you must cite the specific source name (e.g., Bloomberg, TechCrunch, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, a specific market report).

  Structure your output in JSON format. Here are some examples of the desired output format:
  {
    "idea": "An AI-powered platform for personalized corporate training, adapting to employee learning styles.",
    "category": "Online, Tech, B2B",
    "source": "Trending on Hacker News"
  }
  {
    "idea": "Subscription box for artisanal and sustainable coffee from around the world.",
    "category": "Online, Food, Subscription",
    "source": "Reported by Bloomberg"
  }
  {
    "idea": "A marketplace for upcycled and refurbished furniture, focusing on sustainability.",
    "category": "Online, Retail, Eco-friendly",
    "source": "Inspired by a discussion on Indie Hackers"
  }
  
  Your entire response must be a single JSON object matching the schema.

  Focus on feasibility and profitability.
  Consider current events, new technologies, and discussions on platforms like Product Hunt, Hacker News, and Indie Hackers, as well as news from major financial publications.
  Be creative!
  Generate at least 5 distinct ideas.
